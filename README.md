# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 in Rust 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to some challenges from the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

The solutions are present in the `examples/*` folder.

I used these challenges as a way to learn Rust.
The approaches I have chosen are not necessarily the most efficient and idiomatic. 
I often explored alternative strategies to learn something new from Rust with each challenge.

This repository does not contain production-ready performance-optimized solutions.
